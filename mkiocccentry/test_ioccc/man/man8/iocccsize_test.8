.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iocccsize_test.sh
runs a series of tests on the
.BR iocccsize (1)
tool, verifying that it is functioning properly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Show help and exit.
.TP
.BI \-v\  level
Set verbosity level to
.IR level
(def: 0).

A verbosity level of 1 or more will show the PASS or FAIL of individual tests.
.br
A verbosity level of 3 or more will show details such as what was expected and what was discovered during each test.
.RE
.TP
.B \-V
Print version and exit.
.TP
.BI \-i\  iocccsize
Set iocccsize path to
.I iocccsize
(def:
.IR ./iocccsize ).
.TP
.BI \-w\  workdir
Set working directory that is removed and rebuilt during the test of the iocccsize tool (def:
.IR ./test_iocccsize ).
.TP
.BI \-l\  limit.sh
Set path to an executable shell script with the correct specific limits extracted from various files (def:
.IR ./soup/limit_ioccc.sh ).
.RS

.RE
.TP
.BI \-Z\  topdir
Declare the top level directory of this repository.
The
.B topdir
directory must contain the source file
.IR mkiocccentry.c .
By default, the source file
.I mkiocccentry.c
is searched for in the current directory and then the parent of current directory.
.sp 1
If
.BI \-Z\  topdir
is used on the command line, then the source file
.I mkiocccentry.c
need not exist in the
.B topdir
directory.
If
.BI \-Z\   topdir
is not used on the command line, and the source file
.I mkiocccentry.c
is not found in the current directory or the parent of current directory, then this command exits as if there was a command line error.
.sp 1
Once the
.B topdir
directory is established, this command moves to that directory.
.TP
.BI \-I\  iocccsize_args
Set the args to iocccsize.
Don't forget to add
.I \-\-
at the end.
