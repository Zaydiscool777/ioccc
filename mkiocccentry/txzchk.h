/*
 * txzchk - IOCCC tarball validation tool
 *
 * txzchk verifies that the tarball does not have any feathers stuck in it (i.e.
 * the tarball conforms to the IOCCC tarball rules). Invoked by mkiocccentry;
 * txzchk in turn uses fnamchk to make sure that the tarball was correctly named
 * and formed. In other words txzchk makes sure that the mkiocccentry tool was
 * used and there was no screwing around with the resultant tarball.

 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * Dedicated to:
 *
 *	The many poor souls who have been tarred and feathered:
 *
 *	    "Because sometimes people throw feathers on tar." :-(
 *
 *	And to my wonderful Mum and my dear cousin and friend Dani:
 *
 *	    "Because even feathery balls of tar need some love." :-)
 *
 * Disclaimer:
 *
 *	No pitman or coal mines were harmed in the making of this tool and
 *	neither were any pine trees or birch trees. Whether the fact no coal
 *	mines were harmed is a good or bad thing might be debatable but
 *	nevertheless none were harmed. :-) More importantly, no tar pits -
 *	including the La Brea Tar Pits - were disturbed in the making of this
 *	tool. :-)
