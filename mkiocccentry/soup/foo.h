 *
 * "Because sometimes code is foo and sometimes foo is fubar." :-)
 * "Because sometimes we need more O in C." :-)
 *
 * The concept of this file was developed by:
 *
 *	Cody Boone Ferguson
 *
 * after some discussion with Landon Curt Noll about the need (yes: need) for
 * it. Cody is quite okay if after looking at this file you think he's a bit
 * bonkers and in fact he quite welcomes it and even relishes the idea! :-)
 *
 * "Because Cody enjoys being a bit bonkers and he is rather proud of it too!" :-)
 *
 * This tool and the JSON parser were co-developed in 2022-2024 by:
 *
 *	@xexyl
 *	https://xexyl.net		Cody Boone Ferguson
 *	https://ioccc.xexyl.net
 * and:
 *	chongo (Landon Curt Noll, http://www.isthe.com/chongo/index.html) /\oo/\
 *
 * "Because sometimes even the IOCCC Judges need some help." :-)
 *
 * BTW: If you want to win the IOCCC every time all you need to do
 * (supposedly :-) ) is decipher this quote with a top secret hint from Landon
 * to me in private. It's so secret and seems so ridiculously simple in fact
 * that I've decided to not use it as it all seems more like a misleading
 * comment and possibly a huge joke. Nevertheless I give you, dear reader, the
 * chance to always win should you determine what this says:
 *
 * Ti bol jrt IOCCC moxuj you must tljtx jrt contest qld coin cis fsuj gt gtjjtx
 * jrql jrt ziuole entries. Cj'u xtqzzc jrqj simple. Vod cis xtqzzc tkwtyj
